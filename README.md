## Goal

Find solutions to problems in an advent calendar format, where every day a new problem appears. 

My goal in this project is to try to find the cleanest and most performant solution to the problems while keeping a full test coverage.

## Project Setup

If you're curious and want to try my problems, you can follow these steps.

(This takes into account an already set-up Node environment)

 1. Clone this repo on your machine.
 2. Use `npm install`  to install all the required dependencies.
 3. Inside the file `index.ts` located under `/src` edit the day, input the file name, and call the problem you want to try.
	 3.1. Problems are located under `/src` with a folder per each day.
 4. Run `npm start` to view the result.

## Test Setup

If you want to run the tests and see the coverage follow these steps.

 1. Follow the steps stated before to set-up the project
 2. Run `npm test`
 3. After the command ends, you should see an output of the coverage and tests
 4. For more information about the coverage, a folder called `coverage` will be generated for better review.
